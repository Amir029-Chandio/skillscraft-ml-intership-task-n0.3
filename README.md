# Task 03: Cats vs Dogs Image Classification using SVM

## 📌 Objective
To implement a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier that can differentiate between images of **cats and dogs** using image features.

## 🧠 Dataset
The **Dogs vs Cats Dataset** from Kaggle includes thousands of labeled images:
- `cat.0.jpg`, `cat.1.jpg`, ...
- `dog.0.jpg`, `dog.1.jpg`, ...

For performance reasons, a subset of the data was used for training and evaluation.

## 🧪 Preprocessing
Images were:
- Resized to a fixed dimension (e.g., 64x64)
- Converted to grayscale or flattened RGB arrays
- Normalized for SVM input

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV / PIL
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Output
- Binary classification accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- Visual inspection of predictions

## 📁 Files
- `svm_image_classifier.ipynb`: Full implementation
- `dataset/`: Sample images for testing
- `image_preprocessing.py`: Helper functions for loading and transforming images

## 🏢 Internship
This task was completed as part of the **Machine Learning Internship** at **Skillscraft Technology** in 2025.
