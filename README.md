# 🐱🐶 Task 03: Cat vs Dog Image Classification – SVM Model

## 📌 Objective

Classify images as either **Cat** or **Dog** using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Image Preprocessing (Resizing, Flattening, Normalization)
- Data Splitting (Train/Test)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix)

## 🔧 Skills Practiced

- Image Classification
- Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
- Evaluation Metrics for Binary Classification

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains labeled images of cats and dogs (preprocessed version or raw images).

## 📁 Files in Repo

- `cat_dog_svm.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook for training the model
- `images/` – Folder containing sample image data
- `README.md` – You're reading it 🙂
